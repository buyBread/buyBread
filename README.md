## buyBread  
* Learning `C/C++` , `x86 Assembly` and reverse engineering using `IDA` since middle of 2017. Mostly use it for writing random stuff for my own personal use.
* Also picked up `Python` as a 2nd language for more lighter/web related stuff sometime in 2018. I obviously know more, but these are the ones I'm actually competant in.  
* Currently a student in web development, see myself, hopefully, doing it in the future for food.  
* Occasionally I can be found using `Fedora` or `Debian` as my main operating system for various random, sometimes mood related, reasons.
