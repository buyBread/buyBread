* Learning `C/C++` , `x86 Assembly` and reverse engineering using `IDA` since middle of 2017. Mostly use it for writing random stuff for my own personal use. Amen to Game Hacking for making me interested in this field, even if it is slightly toxic.  
* Also picked up `Python` as a 2nd language for more lighter/web related stuff sometime in 2018. I obviously know more, but these are the ones I'm actually competant in.  
* Currently a student in web development, see myself, hopefully, doing it in the future for food.  
* Occasionally I can be found using `Fedora` or `Debian` as my main operating system for various random, perhaps even mood related, reasons that usually lead to more frustration due to me being unaccustomed to writing and compiling my `C/C++` stuff on something that's not `Visual Studio`.
